description: How to get cellfinder installed on a compute (e.g. university) cluster

# Cluster installation

In principle cellfinder can work on any Windows or Linux based cluster, with installation very similar to the [desktop installation](../installation.md).

Currently, instructions are provided for clusters with the [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) workload manager \(based on the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre cluster](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/content/scientific-computing)\).

**See** [**Installation with SLURM**](slurm.md) ****

_If you need help installing cellfinder on a different type of compute cluster \(or even better if you've already managed\),_ [_please get in touch_](../../general/getting-in-touch.md)_._

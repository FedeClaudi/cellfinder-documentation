# Group-level analysis

{% hint style="warning" %}
Group-level analysis is still in development
{% endhint %}

Currently cellfinder works by analysing a single brain at a time. Tools will be needed to help analyse full experiments \(i.e. multiple samples\).

At the moment there is a tool to allow you to summarise the results from multiple samples. See  [Summarising multiple cell counts](untitled-2.md) for details.

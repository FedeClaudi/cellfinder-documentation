# Standalone tools

In addition to the `cellfinder` command, cellfinder is comes with some additional tools. Most of these were developed for specific one-off purposes, but their functionality is now included within the main cellfinder command. They are documented here, but they should be used at your own risk \(they may be removed at any time\).

* [Rescale xml file](untitled-3.md) to spatially scale an output cell candidate \(or classified cells\) list
* [Cropping xml file](untitled.md) to spatially crop an output cell candidate \(or classified cells\) list \(by brain region\)
* [Transforming cells to standard space](untitled-2.md) to transform cell positions from one coordinate space to another
* [Summarising cell counts](untitled-1.md) to "assign" detected cells to a brain region

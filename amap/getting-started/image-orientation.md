# Image orientation

**If the supplied data does not match the NifTI standard orientation \(origin is the most ventral, posterior, left voxel\), then the atlas can be reoriented to match:**

* `--flip-x` Flip the sample brain along the first dimension
* `--flip-y` Flip the sample brain along the second dimension
* `--flip-z` Flip the sample brain along the third dimension
* `--orientation` The orientation of the sample brain `coronal`, `saggital`or `horizontal`

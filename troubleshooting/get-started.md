# How to troubleshoot

{% hint style="warning" %}
A section of how to improve cellfinder's performance will be added 
{% endhint %}

## Introduction

As cellfinder relies on a number of third party libraries \(notably [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) and [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)\) there may be issues while running the software.

## Speed

If cellfinder is slow, there is guidance at [cellfinder is slow](cellfinder-is-slow.md)

## Error messages

Some known error messages \(and how to fix the underlying issues\) can be found at [error messages](error-messages.md)

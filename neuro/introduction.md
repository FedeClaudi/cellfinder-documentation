# Introduction

neuro is an "add-on" module for cellfinder, which will provide additional tools, particularly those for further analysis \(following cell detection and registration\). It is included as part of cellfinder, but the eventual aim is that it can be installed separately \(e.g. on a less powerful laptop\) to allow for exploration, visualisation and futher analysis of previously analysed data.

If you would like a standalone install of neuro, please see [Installation](installation.md).



neuro comes with some standalone tools, please see[ Tools](standalone-tools/) for details

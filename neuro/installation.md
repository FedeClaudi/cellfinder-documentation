# Installation

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you have cellfinder or amap, then neuro is already installed for you
{% endhint %}

## Introduction

neuro is included with cellfinder and amap. Unless you have a particular reason not to, I would install cellfinder as this will install all the packages you may need. See [cellfinder installation](../installation/installation.md).

If you know what you're doing just run:

```bash
pip install neuro
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're not completely sure what you're doing, read on.
{% endhint %}

## Setting up your machine

### Installing Python

neuro is written in Python, and so needs a functional Python installation. Your machine may already have Python installed, but **I recommend installing miniconda**. 

**See** [**Using conda**](../installation/using-conda.md) **for details.** 

{% hint style="danger" %}
neuro should run on any type of Python installation, but if you don't use conda, I may not be able to help you.
{% endhint %}

## Installing neuro

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember to activate your conda environment before doing anything
{% endhint %}

```bash
pip install neuro
```

# Standalone tools

## Manually segment brain regions or tracks

To manually segment brain regions or tracks in standard space that can then be visualised along with other samples \(e.g. in [BrainRender](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainRender)\) see [Manually segment in standard space](manual-segmentation.md).

## Heatmap generation

To generate a heatmap of detected cell positions, see [Heatmap generation](untitled.md)

## Export cell positions to brainrender

To convert cell positions to a format that can be used in [brainrender](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainRender), see [Exporting detected cell positions to brainrender](exporting-detected-cell-positions-to-brainrender.md).
